Make sure to take Note of the Client ID and Token. You will need these later when you begin programming your bot. Do not share this information!

Next you need to invite the Bot to your Discord Server using the following link:
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0

Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE with the Client ID from your created Bot.

    if (message.content === 'ping') {

       message.reply('pong');

       }
